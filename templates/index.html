	BitterBetter is a tool that predicts the bitterness of beers from textual descriptions of them. It also uses information about the alcohol content and style of beer (currently hard-coded to 5.5% and APA for demonstration purposes). 
</p>
<p>
	The imagined use case is for brewers to make sure that their brand story is correctly calibrated to communicate the desired information about bitterness to the consumer.
</p>
<p>
The data for this project was scraped from about 85000 beer entries from <a href="https://ratebeer.com">ratebeer.com</a>. Bitterness is estimated via the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Bitterness">International Bittering Unit</a> or IBU scale, which measures the concentration of certain acids which arise during the brewing process. An IBU rating does not correspond precisely to perceived bitterness but has a high correlation with it.

<p>
Under the hood, the models used are standard NLP tools: the words are tokenized and both individual words and bigrams are one-hot-encoded. A combination of linear regression with Ridge normalization and random forest ensembles are used to generate the predictions.
</p>

<p>
The current results obtain modest but signficant improvemnents over a naive linear regression based only on the alcohol content and style.
