	<h3>BitterBetter</h3>
<h4>A beer bitterness predictor</h4>
<p>
	BitterBetter is a tool that predicts the bitterness of beers from textual descriptions of them. It also uses information about the alcohol content and style of beer. 
</p>
<p>
	The imagined use case is for brewers to make sure that their brand story is correctly calibrated to communicate the desired information about bitterness to the consumer.

<h3>
Background and motivation
</h3>
<p>
Bitterness is estimated via the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Bitterness">International Bittering Unit</a> or IBU scale, which measures the concentration of certain acids which arise during the brewing process. An IBU rating does not correspond precisely to perceived bitterness but has a high correlation with it.
</p>
<p>
<h3>
More information
</h3>
<p>
BitterBetter uses natural language processing methods to predict the IBU rating of beers.
The data for this project obtained from <a href="https://ratebeer.com">ratebeer.com</a> using a custom-built distributed scraper. The database includes over 600,000 beer entries  of which about 85,000 were usable. 
Under the hood, the models used for prediction are standard NLP tools: the words are tokenized and both individual words and bigrams are one-hot-encoded. A combination of linear regression with ridge and lasso normalization and random forest ensembles are used to generate the predictions.
</p>

<p>
The current results obtain modest but signficant improvements over a naive linear regression based only on the alcohol content and style.
