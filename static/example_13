Four ingredients. Painstakingly chosen. Every year, we travel to Bavaria to hand-select Hallertau Mittelfr√ºh hops, and the Pacific Northwest for the finest two-row barley. We cultivate our own lager yeast, and meticulously measure water quality to ensure consistency. All our hard work goes into brewing this distinctly flavorful and complex beer for you. Cheers!
